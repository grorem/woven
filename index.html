                and often associated with fervent nationalistic passion, which leads to a somewhat fanatical form of patriotic allegiance.
                The design artifact, or flag, is comparable to a mythical symbol, that is, for some, infallible. As the design of the flag

                        <p><i>My business ethic has been influenced by mentors and others who have helped me form my management and design style.
                          Now at the later half of my career, I see this opportunity to take my years of business experience and put it to work in
                          education as a teacher and mentor to motivate my students to develop/express their creativity in Graphic Design.</i>

                        <p><i>Self-discovery of my formal and informal education has led me to understand that I have been creating
                          type since elementary school when I experimented with hand drawn type brochures before I even understood what
                          typography or Graphic Design was in the context of the world. All I knew was that I loved to create designs. </i>

              <p><i>Another example of native type I found on the island of Cozumel, Mexico was the word “El Moro”.
                It was tucked away on a side street back from the water line of the main town or maybe the only town on Cozumel.
                This alleyway lead to some deserted homes and finally to the end of the houses in this area. We were looking for a pharmacy
                 to pick up some band-aids, but were having difficulty due to the fact that we didn’t speak much Spanish.

              <p><i>
                Searches on the Internet revealed that “El Moro” refers to the Moors of Spain. When I later consulted Lorena Sheridan-Howard about the origin of “El Moro”,
                she said it was now a common name, but it did have origins in the Moorish tradition in Spain. The lettering extended into a broken plaster free area, so I had
                to imagine what all of the letters looked like.
                 I had only “M”, “O” & “R” to work with, but the overall typeface seemed to reflect the feel of the typeface, Fritz Quadrata, with a swirl of Old Mexico.   </i>

          <div class="col-md-6">
              <p><i>The most basic thing I knew when I arrived at VCFA was that I wanted to work with my hands. I wanted to find a way to practice design that helped me connect body,
                heart and mind. I have discovered that working with my hands making watermarks allows me to
                understand and experience my life more clearly and fully by temporarily bypassing the judgmental part of my brain and working directly with my heart.</i>

          <div class="col-md-6">
              <p><i>The process and methods of making watermarks has become, for me, a metaphor for life. Using my hands and the tools of design,
                I have found a way to reveal, articulate and organize the otherwise amorphous realm of my emotions and the complexities of being in
                relationship with others and with the uncertainty of life.</i>
