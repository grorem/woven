          <h6><i><b>The Challenge</b></i></h6><p>

            It soon became clear that this was not going to be a simple redesign of a website, but so much more a tool to be
            used by an array of different parts of a large organization tasked with representing one of the largest industries in the United States; retail.

          </p>

          <p>

            With this project I wore more hats than just design. My hand touched the information architecture, content strategy, of course design, and taking
            over for a project manager in charge of all the existing content as well as new content, around a decades worth, making it to the new site.

          </p>



          <i><h6>The Process</h6></i>


          <p>

            I traveled to Washington D.C. with a few collegues to conduct stakeholder interviews with the client which kicked off our involvement with the project
            they needed accomplished.

          </p>
          <span class="subHead"><b>Content and Design Space</b></span>
          <p>

            Shortly thereafter, my digital trail of contribution started by undertaking an enormous content-audit which was more than
            just a long slog through a spreadsheet. It was vital in the effort to categorize and keep track of much existing content, as well as inform the new
            information architecture and design templates of a website which reached far beyond simple end-user content.
            <img src="img/NRF_Sitemap.png">


          </p>

          <br><span class="subHead"><b>Interaction Design</b></span>
          <p>

            Working closely with the team, I created these wireframes in our effort to come up with
            the templates that so much content and funtionality would be well fit. Starting with hand-drawn sketches
            of ideas for quick and light iteration, I then moved the ideas to this highly-annotated form to lead discussion with the client
            regarding our recommendation for how to present different content and functionality in different templates with one main breakpoint for responsive display.<br><br>

            <img src="img/NRF_Annotated_Wireframes.png"><br><br>

          </p>


          <br><span class="subHead"><b>Content Management</b></span>
          <p>

            Over the last 2 months of the project, I took over for one of the project managers who had been in charge of all the new site's content on our end. However, a situation arose and I had to step in and do
            about 4 months worth of work, which was neglected, within the remaining 2 months. This included making extensive use of the content management system we had set up, keeping track of old content that
            was to be imported into the new site, working with Quality Assurance to make sure content being imported was up to standards, as well as heading ad-hoc teams to accomplish
            this importation of content. This also included flying back to the client's offices in Washington D.C. for a week, working with their teams and our development team, and training
            their team on the CMS, so future involvement from me going forward with new content would not be necessary.



          </p>



          <i><h6>The Win</h6></i>
          <p>

            More than just a new skin on a website was made. A more engaging and usable experience for the end user and a more usefull
            collaboration platform for internal teams found positive impact on everything from analytics on news published on the site to
            changing some of the internal collaboration flows of the organization for the better.

                  Through years of experience, I have become aware of a number of dualities that comprise who I am as a person, graphic designer, artist and instructor. My work has focused on ways to develop the interaction between these dualities to create a more complete and whole person.

              <p>
                <i>
                At one time, I viewed my personal practice and teaching as opposing dualities. My personal practice seemed to be part of my creative life and teaching part of my professional life. Just like my artist and designer dualities, personal practice and teaching would fight for my time, voice and attention.
              </p>

                <i>

              <p><i>Through the exploration of dualities and discoveries of their dual ties,
                I created The Graphic Designer’s Awareness workbook for senior portfolio students at Stephens College.
                The workbook is intended to help graphic design students, teachers, and practitioners develop personal awareness while building design confidence.
                Once a student has completed the workbook, they will have a greater working knowledge of how to sustain their creative flame for design and inspire others throughout their careers.

                Through personal exploration, I have bridged the gap between my artist and designer and other opposing dualities.
                I understand how the unifying influences of these dual ties have made me a complete being. My personal practice now strongly informs,
                inspires and re-ignites my love for teaching graphic design. </i>

                It was tucked away on a side street back from the water line of the main town or maybe the only town on Cozumel.
                This alleyway lead to some deserted homes and finally to the end of the houses in this area. We were looking for a pharmacy
                 to pick up some band-aids, but were having difficulty due to the fact that we didn’t speak much Spanish.

                Searches on the Internet revealed that “El Moro” refers to the Moors of Spain. When I later consulted Lorena Sheridan-Howard about the origin of “El Moro”,
                she said it was now a common name, but it did have origins in the Moorish tradition in Spain. The lettering extended into a broken plaster free area, so I had
                to imagine what all of the letters looked like.
                 I had only “M”, “O” & “R” to work with, but the overall typeface seemed to reflect the feel of the typeface, Fritz Quadrata, with a swirl of Old Mexico.   </i>

              <p><i>The most basic thing I knew when I arrived at VCFA was that I wanted to work with my hands. I am interested in design as a body-mind-heart experience.
                 When I limit myself to the computer screen, I have limited my hands and as a result, my heart too.
                  I have severely curtailed my physical connection to the work when all the variables are on screen.
                  With the computer, I can easily correct mistakes, it’s hard to make a mess, I am limited physically to my right hand attached to the mouse (or stylus),
                   and my range of motion is tiny. I don’t integrate any other parts of my body with that work.

                Based on research about writing by hand (as opposed to typing): Daniel M. Oppenheime, a psychologist from UCLA, states ‘Maybe it (handwriting) helps you think better.
              I don’t think it’s a huge leap to suggest that working with your hands in whatever you are doing helps you to integrate and process whatever you are working on at a deeper and more integrated level.’” </i>

                  Each color and its level of saturation reflects a particular emotion and its intensity.
                  Working with color is my favorite aspect of these watermarks. Each time I pull a sheet from its container
                  I get a rush from the sheer brilliance of whatever hue is present in its multitude of variations.
