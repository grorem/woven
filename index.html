          <h6><i><b>The Challenge</b></i></h6><p>

            It soon became clear that this was not going to be a simple redesign of a website, but so much more a tool to be
            used by an array of different parts of a large organization tasked with representing one of the largest industries in the United States; retail.

          </p>

          <p>

            With this project I wore more hats than just design. My hand touched the information architecture, content strategy, of course design, and taking
            over for a project manager in charge of all the existing content as well as new content, around a decades worth, making it to the new site.

          </p>



          <i><h6>The Process</h6></i>


          <p>

            I traveled to Washington D.C. with a few collegues to conduct stakeholder interviews with the client which kicked off our involvement with the project
            they needed accomplished.

          </p>
          <span class="subHead"><b>Content and Design Space</b></span>
          <p>

            Shortly thereafter, my digital trail of contribution started by undertaking an enormous content-audit which was more than
            just a long slog through a spreadsheet. It was vital in the effort to categorize and keep track of much existing content, as well as inform the new
            information architecture and design templates of a website which reached far beyond simple end-user content.
            <img src="img/NRF_Sitemap.png">


          </p>

          <br><span class="subHead"><b>Interaction Design</b></span>
          <p>

            Working closely with the team, I created these wireframes in our effort to come up with
            the templates that so much content and funtionality would be well fit. Starting with hand-drawn sketches
            of ideas for quick and light iteration, I then moved the ideas to this highly-annotated form to lead discussion with the client
            regarding our recommendation for how to present different content and functionality in different templates with one main breakpoint for responsive display.<br><br>

            <img src="img/NRF_Annotated_Wireframes.png"><br><br>

          </p>


          <br><span class="subHead"><b>Content Management</b></span>
          <p>

            Over the last 2 months of the project, I took over for one of the project managers who had been in charge of all the new site's content on our end. However, a situation arose and I had to step in and do
            about 4 months worth of work, which was neglected, within the remaining 2 months. This included making extensive use of the content management system we had set up, keeping track of old content that
            was to be imported into the new site, working with Quality Assurance to make sure content being imported was up to standards, as well as heading ad-hoc teams to accomplish
            this importation of content. This also included flying back to the client's offices in Washington D.C. for a week, working with their teams and our development team, and training
            their team on the CMS, so future involvement from me going forward with new content would not be necessary.



          </p>



          <i><h6>The Win</h6></i>
          <p>

            More than just a new skin on a website was made. A more engaging and usable experience for the end user and a more usefull
            collaboration platform for internal teams found positive impact on everything from analytics on news published on the site to
            changing some of the internal collaboration flows of the organization for the better.
